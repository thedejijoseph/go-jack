## Go-Jack

Picking up Golang during my spare time. What project do I run with?

I want to stay away from the web application space for now. I don't have any ideas for cloud tools/infrastructure, or just about any actually useful utilities.

Building this as a port of one my earliest projects written in Python.

Jack is/was (first) a cli tool for generating dictionary-valid words from a given one. So that's what this is going to be.
